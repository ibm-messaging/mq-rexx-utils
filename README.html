<h1>MQ Configuration difference tool MQConfigDiff</h1>
<p>This tool provides rexx execs to take output from CSQUTIL or runmqsc and create HTML pages so you can compare and contrast the 
differences on MQ object and their attributes.
<p>You will need rexx installed on your machine.  These rexx programs have been tested in Redhat(R) V7 and Windows(R) V10.
<p>Differences are highlighted.  You can display all attributes, or just different attributes.  
The example below is a cut down version showing just the queue manager and a few local queues.
<h1> Data processed on 16 Apr 2016 10:31:16</h1>
<TABLE BORDER=4 CELLSPACING=4 CELLPADDING=4>
<TR>
<TD>Summary of objects</td><td>all attributes</td><td>differences</td>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><a href="./QMGR.html">QMGR</a></td>
<TD><a href="./QMGR_detail.html">All details</a></td>
<TD><a href="./QMGR_difference.html">Differences</a></td>
</TR>

<TD><a href="./QLOCAL_detail.html">All details</a></td>
<TD><a href="./QLOCAL_difference.html">Differences</a></td>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<p>You can use this to compare queue managers and see which attributes are different; or compare attributes from one queue manager at 
different points in time to see what has changed between the two times.
<p>If you click on the links, the columns have names 
<ul>
<li><i>MQP1.out.)MQP1</i>, This mean the queue manager )MQP1 came from file MQP1.out 
<li><i>n7.defs.txt.out.colin</i>, this means queue manager colin from the file 7.defs.txt.out.
</ul>
This allows you to pass in files like MQP1.March20.out and MQP1.March30.out and see the differences.
<h1>Syntax</h1>
<h2>CSQUTIL</h2>
<i>rexx  mqzos.rexx infile < outfile > </i>
<p>
where infile might be MQP1.defs and outfile will default to infile.out
<h2>runmqsc</h2>
<i>rexx  mqdist.rexx infile < outfile > </i>
<p>
where infile might be default.defs and outfile will default to infile.out
<h2>Compare the files</h2>
The above processing converts the input files to one keyword value pair per line.
to create the html
<p><i>rexx to html.rexx output1 output2 ...</i>
where the output1 and output2 etc are the output files from the mqzos and mqdist commands.
<p>Then browse the aStart.html file in your directory.
<p>The execs will erase any files before recreating them, so rename, or take a copy of the files you want to keep.
